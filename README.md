## What I do
At GESIS, Iâ€™m part of the Designed Digital Data team, focusing on providing an easy to use, transparent and secure infrastructure for collecting mobile survey and smartphone usage data for social science research.

As a PhD student at Ulm University, I am part of the molecular psychology lab and investigate how interpersonal relationships can be quantified using chat logs, specifically donated WhatsApp chat logs. I am developing interactive methods for transparent data donation methods, and investigate how social relationships are expressed through different communication patterns.
